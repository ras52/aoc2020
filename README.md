Advent of Code 2020
===================

I thought it might be fun to attempt to tackle Eric Wastl's [Advent of
Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenge using my [bootstrap
compiler](https://github.com/ras52/bootstrap), as well as being useful
exercise for debugging the compiler.  This compiler supports a subset of
C, fairly similar to that described in the 1st edition of K&R.

As I start this challenge on 1 December, I don't know how complex the
steps are likely to be, and whether a C-like language will prove a good
choice.  Nor do I know how much more work fixing bugs and implementing
new functionality I'll have to put into my compiler to make, but it'll
be interesting to see.
